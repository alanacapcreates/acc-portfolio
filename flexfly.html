                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Traveling can be a very stressful endeavor. Between flight delays, hidden fees, and all the stress in between, it can be hard to stay calm and collected throughout the entire traveling process. That's where we step in. This product serves both as tool and resource to help inform all travelers - both experienced and inexperienced - of any flight related details. To mitigate the stress, we provide a tool that breaks down communication barriers and informs the user of any delays, important security protocols, and more.</p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our design is to be an assistant to our users, so if we have to choose between usefulness of a feature versus elegance, we should always choose usefulness.</li>
                            <li>Our design is to be a useful toolbox to mitigate the stress of traveling. Every feature should make sense and not make the user ask "what does this do? Why is it here?"</li>
                            <li>Our desire is for our users to feel calm and collected. Our features are to help break down communication barriers because without communication, there is no trust — and without trust, there are no customers.</li>
                            <li>Our users' needs have grown with the research our team has conducted. It is imperative that we keep their needs a top priority.</li>
                            <li>Our design should be intuitive to seasoned travelers as much as to novice travelers. Usability and accessibility should come first. We should keep our design consistent and language simple.</li>
                        </ul>
