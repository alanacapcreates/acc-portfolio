                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Online shopping is dominating how the average person approaches new purchases. With that in mind, it is important to instill trust with potential customers by making sure the brand identity correlates with the trends of today.
                    </br></br>
                    Ketcham, formally Ketcham Medicine Cabinets, sought out to appeal to today's minimalist modern world.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>              
                    <h3>The Goal</h3>
                    <p>Redesigning the current Ketcham Medicine Cabinets logo to represent the multitude of products that they offer, yet still showing the simplistic nature of the overall brand.</p><br>
                    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
                    <p>Pencil Sketches | After Effects | Illustrator | Photoshop</p><br>

            <div>
              <h3>Previous Logo Design</h3>
              <p>The previous logo design does not properly represent the identity of Ketcham Medicine Cabinets. There is no distinction between Ketcham and its competitors, such as Kohler. Using the block lettering in conjunction with a gradient fill gives off a dated impression, and does not engage the customer's eye. </p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                  Before starting the rebranding process, we needed to assess how Ketcham's customers are accessing their product. Are they browsing on desktop, tablet, or mobile devices? Relying on printed literature? Referrals from other people? None of the above? One way Ketcham sought to answer this question was through launching a social media campaign for their new LED mirror line. This campaign ran from August 2020 to October 2020 and was promoted on both Facebook and Instagram. Prior to the launch of this campaign, it was assumed that the majority of users would stem from a mobile platform, given the increasing reliance on mobile technologies.
                </p>

                </br>

                  <p>The goal of this campaign was to:</p> <br>
                  <ol  style="font-weight: 700;list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li>Promote the new product line.</li>
                    <li>Understand which products customers are drawn to.</li>
                    <li>Examine which devices and platforms this online traffic is coming from.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <br>
                  <p>Overall, the most used platforms were the Instagram and Facebook mobile app, compared to their desktop versions. Results of this campaign showed that <span class="bold">49,288 people viewed the products on a mobile device</span>, while <span class="bold">83 people were viewing on a desktop computer.</span>

        <!-- INSPIRATION -->
        <section>
              <div>
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>
                  As shown by the research above, mobile devices have a significantly higher user base for browsing, as opposed to a standard desktop computer. With this in mind, these devices all share a portrait orientation. Comparitively, a large majority of Ketcham’s products also exhibit this rectangular / portrait orientation. The overall goal of the Ketcham rebrand is to identify better with its customers. By uniting the idea of orientation between the physical and technological spaces, Ketcham is one step closer to becoming a relatable brand.
                </p>
                <p>Ketcham supports both the average homeowner through online retail, as well as the architects and contractors behind large-scale construction projects. Now that we can relate to the homeowner by device orientation, it’s time to discover how we can appeal to architects and contractors. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                 We can also relate to architects in terms of orientation. In a very basic sense, the average residential and commercial spaces share clean edges and rectangular structures. Keeping that in mind, I decided to play around with a “blueprint” concept. This field relies heavily on schematic design to get the job done. A blueprint provides the overall goal of a project. Ketcham wants their customers to know that they aim to provide you with everything you need for your medicine cabinets and washroom mirrors. 
              </p> 
              </div>
  
            
              <div class="div-bg-img" style="background-image: url('./img/kmc-rebrand/pexels-tima-miroshnichenko-6615234.jpg')"></div>
            
      
              <div>
                <p>It was important to highlight that Ketcham is more than a "medicine cabinet company".
                  With <span class="bold">450 products in their catalog</span> ranging from medicine cabinets to washroom mirrors to LED mirrors, there is an abundance of unique size configurations and styles: round, oval, and rectangular, in which many can be mounted either horizontally or vertically. With such variety in product and exceptional customer service,<span class="bold"> there are many layers to this company.</span>
                  <br><br>
                  To hone in on the multi-layer idea, the first thought that came to mind was overlapping the characters within “Ketcham”. This would not only emphasize this top-down layered metaphor, but also <span class="bold">create a distinguishable mark</span> that can separate this company from its competitors. Some competitors include Kohler and American Pride Medicine Cabinets. Both of these company logos are wordmark based. As we transition into 2021 with a new brand identity, we wanted to create a more eyecatching design.</p>

        <section style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
          
              <div>
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>The sketch below plays on the architectural and layered concept mentioned above. The far left variation was to sketch out the overall look and feel of the logo. This was purely overlapping the characters to get a better understanding of placement. The middle variation was going more in depth on what I thought should be the emphasis within this design. In this case, I decided that the “K” is not only the topmost layer for this logo, but the distinguishable mark that we needed, to gain recognition in the retail space. Lastly, The rightmost variation is working with full color, and deciding which elements should have the most contrast. To maintain consistency, Ketcham wanted to keep the same color pallete: blue and black. In general, black holds the most emphasis in a design and is the most eyecatching when visual hierarchy is approached correctly. This generalization led me to have the “K” in black, and the remaining characters in blue.</p>

        <!-- DESIGN | OTHER OPTIONS -->
        <section style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
          
              <div>
                <h3>Design | Other Options</h3>
                <p>There were other contenders for the new logo design. This was going to be a big change for the company owners, so with that change comes the emotional attachment to the original.
                </br></br>
                  The goal was to fully represent Ketcham and what they stand for: bringing exceptional products that can fit every size and budget.
                </br></br>
                  There was pushback on what is now the final design. Since a horizontal orientation was what the original design consisted of, that was the route the client was hoping for. Below are the horizontal variations that were created. After multiple discussions, it was decided that, as clean as these designs may look, they do not do the brand any justice.
                </br></br>
                  You will notice there are two versions of the original sketch. The top version was not successful because it lacked visual hierarchy. Overall, this design is minimal and clean, which was part of the goal. However, by having the “K” in the same stroke weight as the other letters, there was nothing to emphasize Ketcham as a whole. The thin approach made the “K” look like more lines in the design and lacked individualism. By increasing the font weight of the “K”, we create the emphasis and unique identifier that was desired from the start.</p>

                  <li>LED logo: to specifically advertise all illuminated mirrors and medicine cabinets.</li>

              <h3>Final Takeaways</h3>
              <p>Overall the stakeholder gave positive feedback. It is extremely important to support your design decisions with research. At one point there was concern about horizontal orientation. This is where the social media campaign research came in handy. Research was key in shaping the decision making process. If I were to approach this project differently, I would have done additional research and developed user personas to further understand our target audience.
              </br></br>
              This is the biggest change the company has endeavored in years. Now that the logo has more appeal to our audience, it is anticipated that this will help drive more sales and project inquiries.</p>
