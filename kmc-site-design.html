                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The E-Commerce industry is growing exponentially. With that said, it is imperative to have a reliable online presence as a supplier. Ketcham wanted their website to have a greater ROI, and in order to obtain that, a website design overhaul was needed. Not only did the aesthetic need a refresh, but the way in which the information was being conveyed needed to be addressed.
                        </br></br>

                    </div>
                    <div>              
                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <p>Now that Ketcham has a new brand identity, the next step is to match that aesthetic with an updated website.</p><br>
                        <h3>Tools Used</h3>
                        <p>WIX | JavaScript | Photoshop</p><br>

            <section style="margin-bottom: 75px;">
                <div>
                  <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                  <p>Version 1 of the Ketcham Cabinets site had numerous pain points. The biggest pain point however, was the overall navigation of the site. Users found it difficult to find the information they wanted. </p>
                </div>
              <br>
                <div class="painPoint">
                    <img class="painPImg" src=".\kmc-site-redesign\kmc-site-v1\KMC-old1.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>When entering the original site, the user is presented with a splash screen and a "click here to enter" call to action. This was very popular 10 or so years ago, but as the web became more popular, the extra click is exhausting. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="painPoint">
                    <img class="painPImg" src=".\kmc-site-redesign\kmc-site-v1\KMC-old2.png">
                    <br>
                    <p>Once the user clicks to enter the site, they are now on the tre hoem page. Here is where you can see the different products Ketcham has to offer, ranging from single door cabinets, to washroom mirrors. 
                    <br><br>
                    The scrolling banner slideshow shows potential, but that doesn't match the rest of the design. At the top you will notice there is a message to homeowners and professionals. There is no distinguiable difference between the two which can make it more of a hassle to the end user to find the information they need. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="painPoint">
                    <img class="painPImg" src=".\kmc-site-redesign\kmc-site-v1\KMC-old3.png">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>If you are curious about the Single Door cabinets, and you click the first navigation button, you are brought to this screen, showcases the many series' Ketcham offers. On the left hand side you will notice all products they offer, as well as a breakdown of size options by width, height, depth. Right away, the eye has a lot to take in. Should the user look into a series? Or narrow down the search by the filter menu?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="painPoint">
                    <img class="painPImg" src=".\kmc-site-redesign\kmc-site-v1\KMC-old4.png">
                    <br><br>
                    <p>If the user selects a series, in this case the Deluxe Series, we now see a breakdown of what this product line is about. There is a lot of information about this series, which is great! The pain point here is that since there is so much informatioon, it needs to be organized in a more digestable manner.
                        <br><br>
                    This series in particular comes in about 16 size options, across three door styles, totaling up to 48 variations in this group alone. Ketcham caters to the homeowners market, as well as the architectural market. For the homeowners who are not familiar with the construction elements of a product, how are they able to see the difference between a 16"x22" cabinet versus a 20"x26" ? People are shifting to be more of a visual learner. This current site does not entertain this.
